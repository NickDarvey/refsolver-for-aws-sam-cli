Instructions for Claude. My name is Captain.

## Tracking work

1. We use the [WORK](./WORK.md) list to keep track of our high-level progress across sessions. These are our system requirements.
2. Use WORK to write down high-level tasks you learn about.
3. Ask for clarifications when tasks are ambiguous and update the relevant WORK item with details.
4. Maintain your own TODO list with the granular steps you are going to do to complete the work item in this session.

## Starting work

1. Create a branch for new work items started WORK.

## Completing work

1. Before considering work done, validate it with tests or another means.
2. Open a PR to contribute the work back to the master branch.
3. Update WORK.md to mark the item as completed.

## Writing code

1. Do not add code comments explaining what code is doing unless it is obtuse.
2. Do add comments that explain why we've decided to write code when it will be non-obvious to the next developer.

## Writing tests

1. Make your tests focus on specific cases.
2. Use AAA-style.
